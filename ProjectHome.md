# SwiFTP is dead, long live SwiFTP #

I (Dave) don't have time to maintain SwiFTP, and since it's a few years since the last update, I'm declaring it dead. However, Pieter Pareit has forked a new version at http://ppareit.github.com/swiftp/ with some badly needed interface improvements.

## News ##

Version 1.24 was released to Android Market on June 27, 2010. It fixes a few bugs.

The 1.2x series adds a new experimental proxy feature, which allows FTP connections from anywhere on the net (including over the 3g connection). Previously, connections could only be made from the same LAN due to firewall and NAT issues.

## About SwiFTP ##

SwiFTP is a FTP server that runs on the Android platform. It emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and small size. It is now considered "stable," meaning that things should work quite well. If you run in to any problems, please report them and they will be fixed.
